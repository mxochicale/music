###  SUPER HUMAN FEAT. OBONGJAYAR & MICHAELA COEL

```

(VERSE 1) OBONGJAYAR

I’ve showed you my darkness
Fed you my flesh
You made anthems of my tears
I'm no super human
I can’t save you and save my self
I'm no super human
Super

(VERSE 2) MICHAELA COEL
(Written by KOJEY RADICAL)

I built my ideals on standards I learned as an infant and then imagined my own, like most curious teenagers no?

I watched my peers walk a path far different to mine and grew more confident with my own solitude

Politics, love, manhood and sexuality I discovered like a blind lamb in the hands of a unfamiliar shepherd

With coloured pigmentation you must accept that your historically pivotal leaders will more than likely be killed

With darker pigmentation you become an example of exoticism under a western microscope

Elements of your identity appropriated and sold back to you with less than clever tag lines

And through it all you must smile

And continue to dance

Yeah keep dancing
Knowing the revenge will taste so much sweeter once you’ve made it


```

"Tomita started arranging Claude Debussy's impressionist pieces for synthesizer and, in 1974, 
released the album Snowflakes Are Dancing; it became a worldwide success and was responsible 
for popularizing several aspects of synthesizer programming. The album's contents included ambience, 
realistic string simulations, an early attempt to synthesize the sound of a symphony orchestra, 
whistles, and abstract bell-like sounds, as well as a number of processing effects including 
reverberation, phase shifting, flanging, and ring modulation. 
Quadrophonic versions of the album provided a spatial audio effect using four speakers" [:link:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Tomita)

### Oscar Peterson 


"Peterson was born to immigrants from the West Indies; his father worked as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway. 
His father, Daniel Peterson, an amateur trumpeter and pianist, was one of his first music teachers, and his sister 
Daisy taught young Oscar classical piano. Peterson was persistent at practising scales and classical études daily, 
and developed his virtuosity thanks to such arduous practice.
At the age of nine Peterson played piano with control that impressed professional musicians. 
For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of daily practice" [ [:link:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Peterson)] .

During live performances, Sandoval prefers to sing in near-darkness with only a dim backlight, playing the tambourine, harmonica, glockenspiel or shaker.
She has a reputation for shyness. Her stage presence has been described as "idly withdrawn, barely acknowledging the audience."

###  Basebarsovia by Jorge Rugerio ( [twitter](https://twitter.com/jrugerio) | [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jrugeriomx/) )
I have been listening to Jorge Rugerio for quite a while, maybe since 2000.
I just got that vague memory in my adolescence, or probably early when I was 10 or 11 years old, when 
I recorded some tapes of rock 101. Then, I just randomly I bumped into "el gordito de la radio" at
[XHOF-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHOF-FM), also known as Reactor 105.7.

In case you want to listen to Reactor, go to [emisoras](http://www.emisoras.com.mx/#reactor) or
[tunein](https://tunein.com/radio/Reactor-FM-1057-s24573/).
You can find other programs from reacher that are worthwhile to listen such as: [MariaLaDelRadio](https://twitter.com/marialadelradio),
etc.
